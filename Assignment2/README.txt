Histogram Equalization and Matching 
Write C++/Image-J modular functions to 

Perform histogram equalization on the 512 Ã— 512 grayscale lena_gray_dark.jpg image. Perform the same on other low-contrast, dark, normal (gray/colored) images. 
Perform histogram matching of the same images with respect to a standard image (e.g. lena.jpg). 
Display the histograms of the original image and the enhanced images and document the observations. 


Running: Run 'Assign2.cpp' to execute the code

For Input, provide images in the same location as the 'Assign2.cpp' file.
For Output, see in the same location as the 'Assign2.cpp' file, histogram output will be created.
